							<h2>on starting a blog</h2>
							<h5><strong>jan. 3. 2019.</strong></h5>
							<section class="wrapper style1 align-left">
							<p>if you’ve explored my website, it wont take you long to realize that i’m an engineering student and i attend an institute of technology. for me, this means the atmosphere which i live in pushes its community to fully commit themselves to understand the technical world society depends upon, be able to continue, and potentially improve these methods of development in the future. even as we students are quite specialized in specific work fields under this definition, the work load required is overwhelming at times and a tremendous amount of energy is spent simply on understanding concepts alone. as i have traveled a year and a half, thus far, down this road, i have found that my lifestyle is drifting from one of a self-expressive nature. instead, a metamorphic process seems to be attempting to transform a <em>proactive</em> person into a <em>reactive</em> one.</p>
							<p>by <em>reactive</em> lifestyle, i mean constantly responding to delegated workloads, focusing on accomplishing repetitive tasks and getting stuck in a mind-numbing routine; ‘going through the motions’. while this process does require a great deal of intellectual thinking and mental energy, it begins to feel very machined. another homework assignment, another test, another grade, another late night of studying. days drag on, yet weeks pass by quickly and suddenly another quarter is in the books (and hopefully the gpa is still intact). life flies by, but what has been accomplished? i feel more intelligent and informed about the world around me, and there’s definitely value in that (something i might expand on later). however, i feel that during my time in college, i haven’t yet applied <em>myself</em> to the world around me. as someone who desires a more <em>proactive</em> lifestyle, it feels as if the mechanical regime stifles creativity.</p>
							<p>i realized this was occurring before beginning this blog, in fact, it’s not my first ploy to cease the ‘metamorphosis’. i suppose it began in conversations with friends and led to my attempt at creativity within my field of engineering specifically: creative engineering design and 'thinking outside the box', startup company ideas and such. this was great for learning purposes and experience, but it still didn’t branch beyond the engineering culture i previously described. recently, i’ve been reading more books and pushing for a wider perspective on the world than i've known or that science can provide, which has been very intriguing and enjoyable. afterall, there is more to life than science and engineering and that’s important to understand. finally, i’ve gotten here: writing.</p>
							<p>i have a few hopes for this blog. first of all, i want to document my thoughts, experiences, and the process i undergo in developing my viewpoint on the world, primarily for myself, but also for those who may want to follow along. additionally, i hope to use writing as a means to express my creativity and pursue proactivity in my life. finally, this is a great new way to build on a skillset in web design.</p>
							<p>so, here is the start of a blog.</p>
						</br>
							<p><em>*note: in pursuit of creativity, i've dismissed the need to follow a few punctuational standards. as i'm sure you've noticed, capitalization as the primary as well as sentence fragments left unbothered. i hope this isn't too distracting. my hope is that my writing sounds more conversational than A+ material as graded by my high school english teacher.</em></p>
